Hello world!

This is my first public repository. It contains a project I made when I am playing around with codes and their syntaxes.
Texts used in this repository were mainly written by me. For exceptions, they are noted with quotation marks.

I am just venturing into this community with a love for typing with my blue switch keyboard, so any advice and/or help is always greatly appreciated.
I can be contacted via email at hsua02466@gmail.com

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.
